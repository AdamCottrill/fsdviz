~/utils/update_ontario_stocking.py
Created: 23 Jan 2019 15:29:22

DESCRIPTION:

This script updates the ontario data in the lake wide cwt database.
Updates include tag type, and sequence number for sequential cwts, cwt
manufacturer (where it should have been Micro Mark (MM))

Updates are preformed on both stocking (below) and recovery (NOT YET)
tables.

This script should be run after the lakewide database has been
built and populated with both US and ontario data.
