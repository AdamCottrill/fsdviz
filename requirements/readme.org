* Pip-compile

This project uses pip-tools to manage its requirements and their
dependancies;

** requirements_base.txt

This file contains all of the packages that are needed to run the
application in production mode. Only those packages required for the
application are included, tools for testing, development, or
documentation are not included.

This file is created by pip-tools based on the contents of `base.in`.
If new packages are added to the application, or existing application
are upgraded, base.in should be edited and pip-compile re-run.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

> pip-compile --output-file=requirements_base.txt base.in
> pip install --upgrade -r requirements/requirements_base.txt

#+END_SRC

** requirements_local.txt

This file contains all of the packages that are needed to run the
application in production mode as well as several packages that are
used during development for testing, documentation, or code checking.
For example, the ~pyshp~ library is required to read shapefiles of
management units but isn't necessary if you are not interacting with
spatial data.

This file is created by pip-tools based on the contents of both
`base.in` and `local.in`.  If new packages are required for the
development, testing, or development of the application, or existing
packages upgraded, local.in should be edited and pip-compile re-run.

#+BEGIN_SRC shell

> pip-compile --output-file=requirements_local.txt base.in local.in
> pip install --upgrade -r requirements/requirements_local.txt

#+END_SRC
