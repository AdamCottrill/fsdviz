~/fsdviz/myusers/tests/test_permissions.py
 Created: 17 Nov 2020 09:24:07

 DESCRIPTION:

  This test file ensures that permissions/authorizations operate as
  expected.  There are currently 4 types of authenticated user (plus
  anonymous users):

   + GREAT_LAKES_COORDINATOR = "glsc"
   + AGENCY_MANAGER = "am"
   + AGENCY_COORDINATOR = "asc"
   + AGENCY_USER = "au"

  agency Manager and agency user currently have the same permissions

   + The Great Lakes Stocking Coordinators are essentially admins and
   should be able to:
      + access the admin page
      + CRUD any stocking event
      + CRUD their bookmarks
      + upload events
      + download stocking data

   + am and asc should be able to:
      + NOT access the admin page
      + create, update or delete only the stocking event
        associated with their agency and lake(s)
      + upload events
      + CRUD their bookmarks
      + download stocking data

   + agency user should:
      + NOT access the admin page
      + NOT be able to create, update, or delete any stocking events
      + NOT upload events
      + CRUD their bookmarks
      + download stocking data

   + anonymous user should:
      + NOT access the admin page
      + NOT be able to create, update, or delete any stocking events
      + NOT upload events
      + NOT be able to create bookmarks
      + download stocking data(?)

There are two types of object that need to be protected - stocking
events and stocking event uploads.


- effected view:
# group and object level:
stocking.event_detail
stocking.edit_stocking_event
stocking.DataUploadEventListView
stocking.DataUploadEventDetailView

# permissions (group):
stocking.upload_events
stocking.xls_events

    TODO

    - create a tempalte tag and verify that buttons and links are
      conditionally rendered in templates

    - create integration tests and verify that users premissions are
      implemented correctly with GET and POST requests



- there are two levels of stocking event permissions:
  + model level - can CRUD
  + object level - can CRUD events from their agency and lake(s)
