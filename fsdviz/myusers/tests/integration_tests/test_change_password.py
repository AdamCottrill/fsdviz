"""Integration tests for the change password template

The change password view uses django's built view but uses custom
template. The tests in this file verify that the custom template
contains all of the necessary elements including error messages and
mark-up.

Tests in this file include:

+ change password login required
+ change password form elements
+ change password form success
+ missing old password
+ old password is incorrect
+ missing password1
+ missing password2
+ passwords don't match
+ password too short
+ password too common
