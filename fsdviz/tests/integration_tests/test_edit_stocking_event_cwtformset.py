~/fsdviz/tests/stocking/test_stocking_event_cwtformset.py
 Created: 11 Aug 2020 09:08:08

 DESCRIPTION:

  The stocking event form has a formset that deals with cwts - the
  logic associated with it is sufficiently complicated to warrant its
  own test file.

  This file contains a number of integration tests that submit GET or
  POST requests to the edit stocking event url with various cwt
  configurations and make assertions about the expected response.

  + if formset contains anything, the form should constain 'cwt' one of
  it's tag types

  + we can create new cwts
      + standard cwts
      + sequential cwt

  + cwt can assocaite an exsiting cwt with and event

  + we can delete an association bewteen a cwt and an event

  + cwt attributes must be unique within a form submission

  + sequential cwts cannot overlap on the same submission

  + sequential cwts cannot overlap with existing cwts
