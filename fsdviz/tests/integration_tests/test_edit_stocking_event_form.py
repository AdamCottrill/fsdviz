 Created: 03 Oct 2019 11:02:02

 DESCRIPTION:

this file contains a number of integration tests that verify that the
edit stocking event form functions as expected.

It should only be accessible to users with appropriate priveleged.  if
an unauthorized use tries to access the url, they should be
re-directed to the login page.

When a logged in use access the url with a stock_id that does not exists,
a helpful 404 page should appear.

When a logged in user accesses the url with a valid stock_id, the form
should render with correct components.

TODO - Add more tests to verify errors and behaviour when good data is
submitted.
