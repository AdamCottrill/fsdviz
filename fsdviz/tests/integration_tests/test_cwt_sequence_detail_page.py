 Created: 25 Feb 2021 08:11:13

 DESCRIPTION:

  The cwt sequence detail page should include information about the
  cwt and its associated stocking events.

  Basic elements:

  - cwt number, manufacturer, tag type,

  - associatd stocking events

  - javascript arrays for map bounds and stocking event data to plot
    the poitns

  Warnings:

  - if the cwt has been stocked in more than one lake, species,
    strain, or by more than one agency, those attributes should be
    identified with a different class to highlight the reuse

  - it the tag is squential the sequence range should appear in
    stocking event header

  - if there is more than one cwt objects (two manufacturers), there
    should be two cwt cards with details of each and the headers of
    the stocking event lists should include the manufacture details
