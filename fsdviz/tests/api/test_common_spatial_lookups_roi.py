 Created: 27 Nov 2020 10:31:18

 DESCRIPTION:

thios test file verifies that the spatial attribute endpoint accepts a
roi as either geojson or wkt and returns the a json response with
attributes of the lakes, jursidictions, and management units that
overlap the region of interest.

This verifies that a valid request procudes a good response and that
the response has the expected attributes, that bad requests are
handled appropriately.
