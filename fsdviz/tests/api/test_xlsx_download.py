 DESCRIPTION:

  The tests in this file verify that the Excel download endpoints for
  stocking events returned the expected results.

  Essentially, the endpoints return a spreadsheet that closely resembles
  the data sumbission template or a json response with the same fields
  that will be used to populate pre-existing spreadsheets for stocking
  coordinators.
